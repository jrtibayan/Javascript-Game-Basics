# Learning Javascript Game 01 - Flappy Bird Like Game
My first project learning javascript game development.  
Below are the things I need to learn in making a basic game.

1. Creating the game area

2. Creating the character and other game object

3. Making the character move

4. Collision and Response

5. Recording and displaying score

With these basic stuff we are going to create a Flappy Bird like game that will be able to do the following

* Create the player character
* Create moving obstacles obstacles
* Dodge obstacles by clicking and releasing the button making the player go up or down
* Player will not go out of canvas
* Player will be scored depending on how long the player stayed alive
* Game will end or player will die if player hits any obstacle
